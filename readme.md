# bibcheck

A tool to check for common mistakes in BibTex and BibLaTeX files.

This tool was inspired by [Common Errors in
Bibliographies](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/biberrors.html) by Professor
John Owens. See the [requirements page](documentation/requirements.md) for the
list of requirements that I derived from this article, and their implementation
status.
